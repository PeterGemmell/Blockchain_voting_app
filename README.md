# Blockchain_voting_app

#### Use Case
The idea behind the blockchain voting app was to explore blockchain technology use cases beyond cryptocurrency. I found a voting app to be particuarly interesting following on from the recent U.S election. I am interested how this could potentially avoid electoral fraud through leveraging the benefits of blockchain and smart contracts.


#### How It Works
The voter would open the page to a list of candidates displayed in the pairing of President / Vice President for which they select one pair. A cryptocurrency wallet, MetaMask in this example, opens to display relevant fees, for which the voter then confirms. Perhaps in a larger scale, these are preloaded by the government in which the voter interacts with a screen at a polling station. Next the screen refreshes, displaying your vote next to the selected candidate with the option to vote now hidden to avoid any double voting.
